Feel free to reach out to me. I am gentle. I promise.

And I don't believe in dumb questions. Ask away, judgement free. Just try to keep it in one message.

*I don't like documentation, as such I don't have much experience for MarkDown*

<details><summary>Advanced tips for getting maximum free help from Pepsi -- (Large content warning/Over explained)</summary>While helping people with their bugs and making small functions are usually free to those who wish to learn, if you want something more than 'help', you'll need to bring some payment. (Important friends get significantly more leeway)

Also, keep in mind while contacting me; you're probably not the only one asking for a piece of my time. Response times can be hectic. I respond to easiest solutions and forms of help first. If your message doesn't inquire anything, expect to be responded when my never ending priority list hits zero. So to prevent that from happening skip right to the chase with a request/question.

To get my help the fastest, try answering "Why did I come to pepsi?" as your message, instead of just typing "Hey, are you there?". Inquires are favorable, and formalities are painful.
Messages like "Hi", "Are you on?", "Can I ask a question?", "Let me know when you get on", "I got this bug and I was wondering if you would help me." have no meaning to me. My attention *cannot* be reserved just for you.

I personally don't like responding with
"Hey, need something?", "I am now, what do you need?", "Yes, what is it?", "Yep. How can I help?", "Sure! What kind of bug is it?" instead of responding with actual solutions and ideas.
And since my responses can easily take a day or more, It's probably best to start with why & what you're contacting me for. Explain a little, show sources, images, discord-embedded videos, tell me what is supposed to happen and what it did instead. In short, asking for my attention, you'll get my attention, but not what you *really* need. Mind you my attention can take a long time to come by.

I only ask for; patience, single message texts (not just one or two words in 10 consecutive messages that form some really dumb vertical paragraph where I have to scroll to read), enforce minimal pings (my notifications are ON, every message sent is the same as an @Pepsi ping sound. You'd probably want to keep me unannoyed...)
Imagine hearing a ping every 3 seconds, only for you to find out that they still haven't finished their one-word-per-message sentence, before finally adding @Pepsi as the last message.

I'm not going anywhere, no need to give me another @Pepsi ping after writing a message. Both make the same annoying sound, notification, and ping.
All tagging me would do, is send me another ping as the 'cherry on top' topping that holds no information, meaning, or contextual data. I tolerate pings, but there is a limit to my tolerance.

Can't design to save my life, so please don't request custom designs. If you have something already designed but need help with its functionality, THEN contact me.

You may wonder why I'd type this much for such a small topic. And you'd be right to wonder. I guess you could say that this is nothing compared to the amount of times I had to drag answers out from someone.
This is a spoiler for a reason. I'm an over-explainer, sorry. ðŸ˜…</details>
